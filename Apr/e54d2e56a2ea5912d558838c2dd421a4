Dr Nonhlanhla Yende-Zuma will graduate with her statistics PhD. Her role at Caprisa involves her analysing research data and determining required sample sizes for studies. Yende-Zuma said she enjoyed the fact that her job had different challenges daily. Yende-Zuma said she had no idea what statistics was when she entered university, but had always loved maths in high school. “When I was in high school, I didn’t know that there is something called statistics because we had no career guidance. All I knew was that I was going to study mathematics whenever I get an opportunity to further my studies. “During registration at UKZN, I was told to register for mathematics and statistics, only to find that I will enjoy statistics more than mathematics and ended up choosing it as my major,” she said. To young women, she said: “You will succeed if you are passionate about numbers and maths. The opportunities are vast - hard work, focus and discipline will allow you to succeed and realise your dreams. Aim high.” Sunday Tribune
