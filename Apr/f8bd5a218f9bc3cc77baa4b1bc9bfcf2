Community leader Silwanaziphi Jama said the situation was calm on the farm. â€œWe are happy that there is calm after two weeks of uncertainty and turmoil. But we wish the police could step up it's investigation and arrest the perpetrators who are tarnishing both the image of the village community and traditional leadership," Jama said. He said community members concerned by last week's protests and criminal acts have submitted a list of names of suspects to police to investigate. The farm owners were not available for comment.
