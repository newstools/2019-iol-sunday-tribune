Richards Bay - Foreign nationals - most of them refugees living in Richards Bay - have come under attack allegedly by taxi drivers. A spokesperson for the foreigners said the conflict started on Wednesday morning and on Thursday the containers from which they run their businesses in the CBD were destroyed. He said the number of people wounded in the attacks were mounting and many had been taken to hospital. At present the various refugee groups are meeting in Richards Bay to discuss safety measures. The latest incident comes months after hundreds of foreigners were displaced following attacks in the eThekwini. The flare-ups took place in the suburbs of Kenville and Seacow Lake in the north of Durban and Sydenham and Overport, just outside the city centre and resulted in the foreigners, Malawian nationals, fleeing their homes and seeking sanctuary at the local police station. Officials denied the attacks were related to xenophobia, instead saying they were criminally motivated. * This is a developing story Sunday Tribune
