Durban - Former African National Congress Youth League leader and uMzimkhulu councillor Sindiso Magaqaâ€™s murder case goes to trial in October. Magaqa was shot in an ambush at Ibisi village two years ago. He survived after being shot on July 13, 2017, but died in September of the same year as a result of his injuries. He was 35 years old at the time of his death. The trial of the men accused of the attack is expected to start on October 14 and is set to last until November 8. Two other councillors who were with him at the time of the attack survived the ambush. Sibusiso Ncengwa, the alleged hitman, was arrested last year. Earlier this year, the other suspects - Mbulelo Mpofana, businessman Mxolisi Ncalane and former policeman Sibonelo Myeza - were taken into custody. The case was being heard in the Mzimkulu Magistrate's Court but was later transferred to Scottburgh. "The matter was at the uMzimkhulu Magistrate's Court yesterday. The accused in this matter were indicted and the matter was postponed for trial. The trial has been set down for the 14th of October until the 8th of November," the National Prosecuting Authority's Natasha Kara said. Charges against the former Harry Gwala mayor and current deputy speaker of the provincial legislature - Mluleki Ndobe and Municipal manager, Zwelibanzi Sikhosana - have been provisionally withdrawn. The two had been arrested in connection with the murder. oliver.meth@inl.co.za Sunday Tribune
