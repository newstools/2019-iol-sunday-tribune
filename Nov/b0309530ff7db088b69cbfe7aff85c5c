I know what it’s like to have your heart broken. I hope Enhle finds or has a safe spot to land on.   I hope Enhle will get the money and property she deserves. I hope she will heal and find love that is wholesome.   Then on the Sunday DJ Blackcoffee disconnects the vibe of the nation. #BLACKCOFFEE #Enhle pic.twitter.com/xDGBGucsYz  It's sad that Enhle & Black Coffee are no longer married. But I have realised that when two people decide to get a divorce, it isn’t a sign that they "don’t understand" one another, but a sign that they have, at least, begun to. pic.twitter.com/feqP1cfKB0   What we're not gonna do is to CALL ENHLE MBALI a GOLD DIGGER !!!?Don't DISRESPECT HER pic.twitter.com/DD0VTDjWti
