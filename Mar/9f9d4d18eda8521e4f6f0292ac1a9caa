Councillor Zama Sokhabase, chairperson of the city’s community services committee, said the money would be used to refurbish and service the facilities under eThekwini’s jurisdiction. Sokhabase said there were 96 libraries across the metropolitan area, two of which were mobile, and three types of museums in the city and all were “functioning very well”. “The money is for daily operating costs, and we are privileged when it comes to resources compared to other, smaller municipalities. “Running these facilities costs about R270m a year,” he said. The three museums are the Local History Museum, which has seven sites, the Natural Science Museum, and the Art Gallery. The DA has called for the speedy procurement of books for libraries. DA caucus leader Nicole Graham said there had been a problem with the tenders for procuring new books for some time. “The tender for new books needs to be urgently resolved so that we can have new books in our libraries. “When we receive grant funding from the provincial government, that funding must be used properly to benefit communities,” said Graham.
