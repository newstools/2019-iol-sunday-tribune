However, residents were urged to use water sparingly because the demand exceeded supplies. Umgeni Water chief executive, Thami Hlongwa, speaking at a briefing to mark World Water Week, said they were hopeful the supply would be enough to go through the winter season without restrictions. “Right now we are trying to balance the water we receive in our dams as well as the output in terms of what we supply to our consumers. “We are comfortable, based on our dam levels, that there will be no restrictions as we move towards the drought season. “We have at least 11% more than what we had during the same period last year without restrictions. “We are confident that we will have enough water until the next rainy season,” Hlongwa said. Good rains in the upper catchments of the Mgeni system, including in the Drakensberg region, led to the Midmar Dam spilling over earlier this month for the first time in a year. Sunday Tribune
