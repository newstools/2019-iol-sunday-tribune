DURBAN - The KwaZulu-Natal MEC of Education is set to meet the families of the schoolgirls who were killed when a minibus taxi ploughed into them on Wednesday morning. Spokesperson for the provincial Department of Education, Kwazi Mthethwa, said MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana was heavily heartbroken upon hearing of teenagers’ deaths. He confirmed that the schoolgirls were heading to the Newlands East Secondary School. Three schoolgirls were killed, and another was critically injured, after a minibus taxi crashed into them as they were on their way to school. Rescue Care spokesperson, Garrith Jamieson, said the crash happened on Dumisanya Makhanya Road near the VN Naik School for the Deaf in Newlands East. “Three of the four had sustained major injuries and unfortunately there was nothing more Paramedics could do for them and they were declared deceased on the scene. One female sustained critical injuries,” he said. While on his way to the accident scene, Mthethwa said he had just briefed the MEC of the accident. According to Mthethwa, the taxi had skipped a red traffic light. “We are saddened by this unfortunate accident. The MEC will visit their families to pay his last respects. Details of his visit will be communicated once finalised,” he said. Jamieson said SAPS were on the scene of the accident and are investigating. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
