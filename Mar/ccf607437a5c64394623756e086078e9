 Goodbye grandma I still don't believe it yet. Your spirit is larger than life, I still feel it with me. I couldn't write anything or say anything yesterday. I tried to pierce through my swollen chest dense with confusion, I tried to squeeze out the feelings that have been pent up in my gut for so many months.. Now your beautiful spirit is soaring with the universe. You are a warrior and hero to me. I either get to honour you with 2 shows here in London or I cancel everything and fly home and stand by you at your final resting place. Everything has just been so quick, so many decisions to make ... I want to do what is best for us and I feel your spirit telling me to continue. I'm so conflicted and so far away. You raised me and taught me everything I know.. would you want me to go on and push forward or let it go? I am comforted by the fact that when you could feel it, I gave you my time. I can't change things now but I can honour your spirit and stand tall in the world, and not give up because it's over but press on because it happened...
