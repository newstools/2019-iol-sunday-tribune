“Six of the ‘Wild Geese’ from distant parts of South Africa will join friends and family at a party on Sunday to honour Mike at his home in Durban North,” his son, Chris, told the Independent on Saturday. His men take this name from a movie about a group of mercenary soldiers hired to rescue a deposed African president. Richard Burton played the part of their leader, patterned on Mike Hoare, who was hired as the technical adviser. “Everyone attending will make a short speech in appreciation of Mike,” said Chris, a journalist, who recently launched Mad Mike Hoare: The Legend, his own book about his father.

One doesn’t remember so well any more. “But I am fortunate to be surrounded by people who care and that takes the sting of old age away.” DUNCAN GUY
