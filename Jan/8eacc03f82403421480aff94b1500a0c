As US President Donald Trump ended the country’s longest shutdown yesterday, expatriates from South Africa living in the US said they were not affected by it. Heather Rodd-Young, formerly of uMhlanga Rocks, Durban, said the shutdown didn’t have any impact on her. “There was no change as I own a preschool close to San Diego. I am a strong supporter of the wall being built as I live close to the border.” Rood-Young said most people she interacted with supported the wall. Trump demanded $5.7billion (R78bn) to build the wall. However, yesterday he succumbed to political pressure and ended the shutdown. Said Rodd-Young: “As taxpayers, the illegals that enter are draining our welfare system. Illegal immigrants are huge crime offenders and drain our court system.” About 800000 federal workers were affected during the shutdown and were struggling to catch up with missed instalments on bills. On Friday, they missed another payday. Barry Gazzard, a former Durban resident based in Atlanta, said: “We are hosting the NFL Superbowl on February 3 (the biggest annual sports event in the US), with 150000 visitors expected, so there was a lot of anxiety here, with many people worried whether the shutdown would end before then.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
