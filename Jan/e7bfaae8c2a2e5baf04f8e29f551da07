Durban - eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede has called on residents of Durban to register to vote, despite the rainy conditions around the city on Saturday. “Let’s not allow the weather to deter us and dampen our spirits. I urge everyone to register,” said Gumede. The mayor, who came under criticism from the DA for sporting ANC regalia during a voter registration campaign on Friday morning, said she spent her Friday mobilising the young voters to register to vote at places like Mayville, the CBD, the market area and the Durban Workshop centre. Her spokesperson Mthunzi Gumede said she was accompanied by Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Ncube-Dube. “Tomorrow the mayor and the MEC will be visiting different congregations to encourage them to register and also go to various voting stations to monitor the progress,” said Mthunzi Gumede. Meanwhile, responding to complaints that the mayor had used state resources to campaign for her party, the ANC, Mthunzi Gumede said: “Mayor Gumede joined the campaign after the Matric Awards ceremony held at Durban ICC at midday. During the course of the morning she was part of the organizational campaign with volunteers mobilizing communities to register. The Mayor has urged youth to use this weekend opportunity to register, this is about the future of the country”. Daily News
