On Friday, Ramaphosa delivered the first Gandhi Mandela Freedom Lecture.He said the legacies of Gandhi and Mandela went beyond their stature as founding fathers. “What they lived for, what they stood for and indeed what they fought for, continues to resonate with people across the world decades since their birth . "We often take for granted the sheer force of will, courage of conviction and strength of character than would have been required at such time.” Ramaphosa took aim at those who have criticised Gandhi and Madiba in recent times. “The issues they advocated for and how they articulated them; the political positions they took and the political decisions they made - will always be subject to interpretation and re-interpretation. “Those of us who have chosen a life of politics, will know too well that the actions we undertake at a particular time will by necessity be held up to public scrutiny by future generations. They may be praised, but they may also be derided or condemned. “Yet we know the transience of politics is one thing, and the enduring nature of universal values - of justice, of equality, of self-sacrifice, of solidarity with the underdog - are another.” Ramaphosa concluded by saying bonds between the two countries would strengthen to ensure a future of hope and renewal. “A future of peace and prosperity for all,” he said. “A future that is bright, and guided by the light of these two great men.” On Saturday, the President will attend India’s 70th Republic Day parade as chief guest, an honour that, historically, has been bestowed upon some of the greatest leaders of our time. In 1995, Nelson Mandela, attended as chief guest. Streets were adorned with flags of both countries while billboards carried a picture of Ramaphosa and the word “Welcome”. At the official home of the Indian president, Rashtrapati Bhawan, Ramaphosa was given a ceremonial welcome.
