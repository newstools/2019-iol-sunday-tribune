A MASS walk is set to get under way at Chatsworth Stadium as part of the “No to jog fees” campaign. The Active Citizens Movement (ACM) planned the community walk to object against the city’s decision to charge residents a fee to use the stadium for jogging. Executive member Desmond Kylas said hundreds of residents used the facility at various times to walk and jog around for recreational purposes. “The permit applies to athletes who use the stadium track to train for competitive purposes. It should not apply to residents,” he said. Kylas has collected over 2000 signatures on a petition to be handed to the office of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede. However, the decision was this week put temporarily on hold. Spokesperson Mthunzi Gumede, said: “The payment of the Athletic Training Permit at Chatsworth Stadium has been temporarily put on hold while municipal officials deliberate on how to best deal with the issue. “Mayor Gumede indicated that she will gather all facts from the relevant officials and engage the municipality’s executive council before a decision is made on whether or not the permits should be paid for by the athletes using the stadium for training purposes,” he said. But Kylas said the community would continue protesting against the permits for residents. “Families come here because it is a safe environment to use. People are voluntarily exercising here, and coming together. “Imagine the effect this will have on families who can’t afford to purchase permits,” he said. The mass walk is expected to take place on January 31, from 5.30pm-7pm at the Chatsworth Stadium. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
