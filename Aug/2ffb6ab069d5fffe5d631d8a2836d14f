Drakensberg Boys Choir spokeswoman Deirdre Alcock said: “There are several Drakensberg Boys Choir School old boys in the Kearsney College Choir, including their director of music, Marshell Lombard.” Boys leave the mountain institute, dubbed “a choir with a school”, when their voices break, and enter a range of high schools throughout the country, among them Kearsney College. Drakensberg Boys’ Grade 7 pupil Seth Brown said he was excited to perform with Kearsney “because I’m going to sing with my brother, and that’s my next school”. “My grandfather and dad went to Kearsney, so I’m keen to do them proud.” Connor McKenzie, who is in Grade 9, expected the performance to be “amazing”. “Both of us are going to bring different things. We’re going to enjoy the time, because both of the choirs are very different. I’ll be attending Kearsney next year, so I’m excited to see what they have to offer.” Tickets at www.webtickets.co.za.
