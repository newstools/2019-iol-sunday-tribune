Durban - A 51-year-old teacher from Melmoth, KwaZulu-Natal is facing charges of rape and attempted murder after allegedly impregnating a 13-year-old learner and tricking her into taking abortion pills. Police said the alleged affair with the learner began in February this year. “The suspect allegedly had a sexual relationship with the minor who was also a pupil at the school. She fell pregnant and informed the suspect of the pains she was experiencing,” said provincial spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. Gwala said the suspect then gave the victim tablets and told her they were for her pain. “The victim became very sick and was taken to hospital in a critical condition where it was discovered that the tablets were for the termination of pregnancy.” The man appeared at the Melmoth Magistrates Court and the case was postponed to 23 September for a formal bail application. He remains in custody. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
