DURBAN - A Durban University of Technology student who was involved in protest action on Tuesday succumbed to injuries and passed away in hospital. The university had been closed ahead of protest action by students since Monday. Alan Khan, a spokesperson for the Durban University of Technology confirmed the death of the student but said the student's identity could not be revealed.
