Acting vice-chancellor Professor Nana Poku, professors Nora H de Leeuw and Peter Amunga Mbati were among those shortlisted. The three candidates submitted presentations on Monday. Poku became acting vice-chancellor in September after Albert van Jaarsveld quit to become director-general and chief executive of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. Poku, a political economist who served as the director in the health economics and Aids research institute at the university, holds various academic qualifications from Coventry and Nottingham Trent universities. He has served as deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Bradford. De Leeuw has been pro-vice-chancellor at Cardiff University since 2014 and a member of the university council since 2015. Mbati is deputy pro-vice-chancellor: academic and quality at Botho University in Botswana. Before that, he was the vice-chancellor and principal of the University of Venda from 2008 to January 2018. The vice-chancellor is expected to play the role of key academic influencer within a scholarly community and work productively with all institutional stakeholders. UKZN spokeswoman Normah Zondo, said the process was still under way and was unable to say when the appointment would be made. Sunday Tribune
