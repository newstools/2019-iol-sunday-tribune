Durban - The queues for the Department of Home Affairs in Commercial Road has spilt onto the road along Dr A.B.Xuma (Commercial) Street. Ralph Phillips a Durban resident said he arrived at 6.30 am to apply for his child's identification document on Wednesday. By midday, the queue still remained long. Phillips said people were standing on the pavements outside the offices while other queues snaked around a car in a parking lane and then onto one of the traffic road lanes "This is a dreadful experience for us. I had to push myself against the parked cars to avoid being knocked from behind by vehicles and mini-bus taxis. The security guards are dictating where we should stand. Nobody wants to move to safety in case they lose their place in the line," he said. The queue contained a mixture of people from all different ages including school children. "I have been bobbing and weaving since this morning," Phillips said. In an online press statement, the Department of Home Affairs said they were declaring war on queues. The DHA said they are experiencing high client volumes nationwide. They attribute this to unpredictable walk-ins because of discontinuation of the Saturday extended hours. The DHA blames inadequate floor management and front office space, network interruptions, inefficient workflow process and uncoordinated client engagement strategies. Daily News
