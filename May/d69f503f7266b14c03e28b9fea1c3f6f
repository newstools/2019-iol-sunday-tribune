However, the foundation’s leader, Sipho Zungu, denied the allegation. Attorney Kershnie Govender, PFS’s legal representative, alleged the foundation’s affiliates had visited many of their members and given them seven days to replace foreign drivers with locals. “If we don’t comply, they attack and burn our trucks.” Govender said threats were also made against the property and family of the PFS members, and even trucks driven by local drivers were attacked. On April 5, PFS and ATDF members met to find a way forward. “We have a video recording of the meeting where Mr Zungu asked his members to stop burning vehicles ‘because talking and engaging is the only way to solve problems’. But on the same day, one of our trucks was burnt,” Govender claimed. She questioned whether all ATDF members were drivers and why it required membership fees when the Department of Labour recommended unemployed drivers register services for free with Employment Services SA. Zungu said it was not responsible for the attacks and the PFS should stop employing foreign drivers. “All our members are employed or unemployed drivers. We charge employed drivers a one-off fee of R200.” Sunday Tribune
